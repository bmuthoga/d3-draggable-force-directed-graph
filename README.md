# D3.JS Draggable Force Directed Graph
This is a draggable `force directed graph` demonstrating the concept of building such graphs

The graph is built with `D3.JS` and `SVGs`

It combines the concepts of [this](https://github.com/bmuthoga/d3-nodes-in-force-directed-graphs) and [this](https://github.com/bmuthoga/d3-links-in-force-directed-graphs) project

One can `drag / move` individual nodes by `clicking and dragging` them

It can also be found on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/bmuthoga/pen/wvBxQyx), and on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/d3js-draggable-force-directed-graph-py3rf)

Below is a preview of how it looks like:
